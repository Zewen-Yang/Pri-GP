abstract = {This paper introduces an innovative approach to enhance distributed cooperative learning using Gaussian process (GP) regression in multi-agent systems (MASs). The key contribution of this work is the development of an elective learning algorithm, namely prior-aware elective distributed GP (Pri-GP), which empowers agents with the capability to selectively request predictions from neighboring agents based on their trustworthiness. The proposed Pri-GP effectively improves individual prediction accuracy, especially in cases where the prior knowledge of an agent is incorrect. Moreover, it eliminates the need for computationally intensive variance calculations for determining aggregation weights in distributed GP. Furthermore, we establish a prediction error bound within the Pri-GP framework, ensuring the reliability of predictions, which is regarded as a crucial property in safety-critical MAS applications.},
